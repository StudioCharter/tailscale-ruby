#Tailscale API

#### Overview  **The API endpoints documented here are stable. However, the OpenAPI spec used to generate this documentation is unstable. It may change or break without notice.**  The Tailscale API is a (mostly) RESTful API. Typically, both POST bodies and responses are JSON-encoded.  ### Base URL  The base URL for the Tailscale API is https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/.  Examples in this document may abbreviate this to `/api/v2/`.  ### Authentication  Requests to the Tailscale API are authenticated with an API access token (sometimes called an API key). Access tokens can be supplied as the username portion of HTTP Basic authentication (leave the password blank) or as an OAuth Bearer token:  ``` // passing token with basic auth curl -u \"tskey-api-xxxxx:\" https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/...  // passing token as bearer token curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer tskey-api-xxxxx\" https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/... ```  Access tokens for individual users can be created and managed from the [Keys](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) page of the admin console. These tokens will have the same permissions as the owning user, and can be set to expire in 1 to 90 days. Access tokens are identifiable by the prefix tskey-api-.  Alternatively, an OAuth client can be used to create short-lived access tokens with scoped permission. OAuth clients don't expire, and can therefore be used to provide ongoing access to the API, creating access tokens as needed. OAuth clients and the access tokens they create are not tied to an individual Tailscale user. OAuth client secrets are identifiable by the prefix tskey-client-. Learn more about [OAuth clients].  [ OAuth clients ]: https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/  ### Errors  The Tailscale API returns status codes consistent with standard HTTP conventions. In addition to the status code, errors may include additional information in the response body:  ``` {   \"message\": \"additional error information\" } ```  ### Pagination  The Tailscale API does not currently support pagination. All results are returned at once.

  # unit tests for create_posture_integration
  # Create a posture integration
  # Create a posture integration, returning the resulting [PostureIntegration](#model/postureintegration).  Must include &#x60;provider&#x60; and &#x60;clientSecret&#x60;.  Currently, only one integration for each provider is supported.  OAuth Scope: &#x60;feature_settings&#x60;. 
  # @param tailnet The tailnet organization name.  When specifying a tailnet in the API, you can:  - Provide a dash (&#x60;-&#x60;) to reference the default tailnet of the access token being used to make the API call.   This is the best option for most users.   Your API calls would start:    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh   curl \&quot;https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/tailnet/-/...\&quot;   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  - Provide the **organization** name found on the **[General Settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general)**   page of the Tailscale admin console (not to be confused with the \&quot;tailnet name\&quot; found in the DNS tab).    For example, if your organization name is &#x60;alice@example.com&#x60;, your API calls would start:    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh   curl \&quot;https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/tailnet/alice@example.com/...\&quot;   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;    Learn more about [tailnet organization names](https://tailscale.com/kb/1217/tailnet-name#organization-name).
